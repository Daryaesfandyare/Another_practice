         <p id="paragraph-1">The Persian cat is known and loved for their very sweet, gentle, calm disposition. Though Persian cats are quite friendly, they require gentle handling, which means no roughhousing or grabbing from young children. They get along great with kind, respectful kids, but would rather be stroked and admired than engage in strenuous activities. Persians also enjoy the company of other cats and gentle dogs if they are introduced properly. 
         Persians love to sprawl out in their favorite spot in the home with good vantage points to keep an eye on the goings-on in the household, be it a plush chair or atop a cat tree. Persians are homebodies. It’s best to keep them indoors to prevent overheating or tangling up their profuse, long coats. Persian cats love their human families, but they don’t mind being left alone for short periods of time as long as they are in their own homes where they feel comfortable and safe.

          <p id="paragraph-2">The big, beautiful ragdoll cat does not reach their full size, about 15 pounds on average, until about four years of age. With their easygoing personality and social temperament, the ragdoll is ready to befriend just about anyone. Prepare your lap for extended cuddling sessions where they'll flop like a mop across your legs and expect enthusiastic belly rubs. Ragdolls don't need a lot of exercise or rambunctious play time, but snuggle time is essential.
            They make great, loving companions for adults and respectful children. With proper introductions, they can get along with other pets in the house as well. Overall, they want to be near their families and crave their humans' attention.

          <img id="image-3" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/440y9b545yd9/3mXEPSN2Ap12wAnFz8dVm2/8b34d9e82f41b11fcee66cc1fc741724/Scottish_fold_5_things_hero850.jpg">
          <p id ="paragraph-3">The Scottish Fold’s ancestry lies with farm cats, and as you may imagine, a Scottish farm cat needed to be a rugged and hardy animal. Although the show example has come a long way since those days, this is still a robust, tough natured cat. 
          They are easily adaptable to most situations, not worried about loud or busy homes but equally at home in a quiet, single person’s abode. They are said to have a sweet disposition and a tiny voice which is used very rarely.
